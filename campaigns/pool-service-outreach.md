## Email Template 1: Pain Point

Subject: Scheduling headaches?

Hi {{first_name}},

Saw {{company}} on Google - looks like you're running a solid pool service operation.

Quick question: How are you handling scheduling and route optimization right now? Spreadsheets? Paper?

We built PoolPulse specifically for pool service companies. One customer told us it cut their admin time in half.

Worth a 10-minute call to see if it could help {{company}}?

## Email Template 2: Competitor Pain

Subject: Frustrated with Skimmer?

Hi {{first_name}},

A lot of pool service companies have told us Skimmer keeps crashing or their prices doubled overnight.

If that sounds familiar, we built PoolPulse as a simpler, more reliable alternative:
- Works offline (even with bad signal at pools)
- Chemical tracking with LSI calculator
- Route optimization to save gas

Would you be open to a quick demo?

## Email Template 3: Social Proof

Subject: How {{nearby_company}} saves 5 hours/week

Hi {{first_name}},

Pool service companies using PoolPulse are saving an average of 5 hours per week on scheduling, invoicing, and route planning.

I noticed {{company}} serves the {{city}} area - would this be useful for your team?

Happy to show you a quick demo. Takes 10 minutes.

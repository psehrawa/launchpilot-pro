## Why Teams Are Switching from Apollo

Apollo.io is a powerful platform, but its pricing has become a barrier for startups and small teams:

- **Per-user pricing** adds up fast ($49-119/mo × team size)
- **Credits expire monthly** — use them or lose them
- **Complex feature tiers** — basic features locked behind expensive plans
- **Enterprise bloat** — paying for features you'll never use

LaunchPilot Pro offers the same core functionality at startup-friendly prices.

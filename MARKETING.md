## ✉️ Outreach Campaign

### Email Template 1: Apollo Pain Point

**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- A: "Tired of paying $99/mo for Apollo?"
- B: "What if Apollo was free?"
- C: "Your Apollo credits just expired. Again."

**Body:**
```
Hey {{firstName}},

I noticed {{company}} is in the {{industry}} space. Quick question:

Are you still paying $99/mo for Apollo? 

We built LaunchPilot Pro after getting fed up with:
→ Credits that expire every month
→ Per-seat pricing that kills team budgets  
→ Enterprise features we never used

Same core features. AI-powered email writing. Free tier that actually works.

Worth 2 minutes to check out? → https://launchpilot-pro.vercel.app

{{senderName}}

P.S. Our free tier gives you 100 contacts and 200 emails/month. No credit card.
```

### Email Template 2: Cold Outreach for Agencies

**Subject:** "New tool for your client outreach?"

**Body:**
```
Hey {{firstName}},

Running outreach for clients gets expensive fast when you're paying per-seat for every tool.

We built LaunchPilot Pro specifically for agencies like {{company}}:

✓ One price, unlimited team members
✓ AI writes personalized emails (saves hours)
✓ Multi-client campaign management
✓ Starts at $19/mo (free tier available)

Currently migrating agencies from Apollo/Lemlist who are tired of per-seat pricing.

### Email Template 3: Startup Founder Angle

**Subject:** "The $99/mo tax on startups"

**Body:**
```
{{firstName}},

When we were building our startup, we spent more on sales tools than on coffee.

Apollo: $99/mo
Lemlist: $87/mo
Hunter: $149/mo

That's $335/mo before sending a single email.

So we built LaunchPilot Pro. Same features, startup pricing:
→ Free tier: 100 contacts, 200 emails
→ Paid: $19-49/mo (whole team, not per seat)
→ AI writes your outreach

https://launchpilot-pro.vercel.app

Built by founders, for founders.

## 🌐 Community Seeding

### Reddit Strategy

**Target Subreddits:**
- r/sales (1.2M members) - SDRs, sales pros
- r/startups (1.1M members) - Founders
- r/SaaS (200K members) - SaaS founders/operators
- r/Entrepreneur (3.5M members) - General business
- r/coldemail (smaller but targeted)

**Post Templates:**

**r/sales - Value Post:**
```
Title: "Built an Apollo alternative after our team blew through $500/mo in credits"

Body:
Our 3-person sales team was paying $300/mo for Apollo. Credits expired every month. We barely used half the features.

So I spent 2 weeks building an alternative that does 80% of what Apollo does for 20% of the price.

Main differences:
- Free tier with 100 contacts/200 emails (actually usable)
- $19-49/mo paid tiers (whole team, not per seat)
- AI writes personalized emails
- Credits don't expire

Anyone else frustrated with sales tool pricing? Would love feedback from actual SDRs.

**r/startups - Founder Story:**
```
Title: "We replaced $400/mo in sales tools with something we built in 2 weeks"

Body:
Our stack: Apollo ($99) + Lemlist ($87) + Hunter ($149) = $335/mo

For a pre-revenue startup, that's insane.

So we built LaunchPilot Pro - combines lead finding, email verification, and sequences in one tool. Free tier that works, paid starts at $19/mo.

Not trying to be the next Salesforce. Just want something that works for startups who can't afford enterprise pricing.

Launched last week, would love feedback from other founders dealing with the same problem.
```

### Twitter/X Strategy

**Thread 1: The Problem**
```
1/ Sales tools are taxing startups to death.

Apollo: $99/mo per user
Lemlist: $87/mo per user  
Hunter: $149/mo

For a 3-person team? $500+/mo before you send a single email.

🧵 Here's what we did about it...

2/ The dirty secret about credits:
- They expire every month
- You lose what you don't use
- "Unlimited" has fine print

We burned through $500 in one month and still ran out of credits mid-campaign.

3/ So we built @LaunchPilotPro

Same core features:
→ Lead discovery
→ Email verification
→ AI-powered sequences
→ Campaign analytics

Different pricing:
→ Free tier: 100 contacts, 200 emails
→ $19-49/mo (whole team, not per seat)

4/ The best part?

AI writes your cold emails. Not templates. Actually personalized based on the prospect's company and role.

Saves hours of "Dear {{firstName}}" customization.

5/ We're not trying to replace Salesforce.

We built this for:
- Solo founders doing their own outreach
- Small teams tired of per-seat pricing
- Agencies running client campaigns

Try it free → launchpilot-pro.vercel.app
```

**Thread 2: Behind the Build**
```
1/ We built a sales platform in 2 weeks. Here's the stack:

Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript
Backend: Supabase (Auth + DB)
Emails: Resend
AI: GPT-4 for email writing
Hosting: Vercel

Total cost: $0 (free tiers + open source)

🧵

2/ Day 1-2: Auth + Database schema

Supabase made this trivial. Magic links + Google OAuth in 20 minutes.

Schema: users, contacts, companies, campaigns, sequences, email_events

3/ Day 3-4: Contact management

Import from CSV, manual add, search/filter.

The unglamorous work that makes everything else possible.

...
```

### LinkedIn Strategy

**Post 1: Founder Perspective**
```
We spent $500/mo on sales tools last year.

Apollo: $99/user
Lemlist: $87/user
Hunter: $149/user

For a 3-person startup, that's a significant burn.

So we built LaunchPilot Pro.

Same features. Different philosophy:
→ Free tier that actually works
→ $19-49/mo (whole team, not per seat)
→ AI writes personalized emails
→ Credits don't expire

Not trying to replace enterprise tools.
Just built what we wished existed.
